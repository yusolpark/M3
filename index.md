## What is M3?

The Modular Mouse Maze (**M3** for short) is a collection of hardware, code, and instructions/tutorials used for mouse behavioral research. M3 is designed around a small number of 3D printable parts and easily connectable, off-the-shelf IIC electronics (including Adafruit's [stemma QT](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt/what-is-stemma-qt) and Sparkfun's [Qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) systems), offering an inexpensive, simple, and highly customizable approach to building a variety of experimental apparatuses, with no cutting of materials or soldering required. Set up classical/operant assays and automated data collection in less time, for less money!

## How to get started?
Want to build a mouse behavioral assay yourself? Simply scroll down the list below and pick the apparatus you'd like to set up. Following the link, you'll find:
1. A shopping list, with links to purchase all required hardware online (NOT affiliate links, we don't profit off of anything here)
2. A set of 3D print files (.stl files), which you can either download to print yourself or order online
3. Some Python/CircuitPython code to download
4. Step-by-step instructions for how to put it all together, including an estimated setup time (typically 1 - 2 hours)
